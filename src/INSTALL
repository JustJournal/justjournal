I am not currently using war file deployments.  I've been
just pointing a context root in tomcat to a directory.  I'm working
on war deployments.  In addition, a database connection reference
must be created.  This is usually different among servlet container
implemenatations.

In tomcat, this might work in the web.xml
 <resource-ref>
        <description>DB Connection</description>
        <res-ref-name>jdbc/jjDB</res-ref-name>
        <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
        <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
        <res-sharing-scope>Shareable</res-sharing-scope>
    </resource-ref>

The current problem with just journal aside from war deployment,
is that it was a hack job originally and makes references both
to the domain name and / throughout the code.  I'm working on a
global settings class to fix these problems so the code is
reusable.

I'll include a web.xml and maverick.xml sample file eventually along
with xsl style sheets and jsp files needed to make the site work.  I'm
moving away from JSP currently toward XSL/XML.  Do to incompatibilities
with recent domify versions, i'll either need to move to cvs maverick or
drop it all together.

The database documentation is in /database.

ant:
I've recently created an ant build script.  We'll be moving to this over time.

In addition to deploying the war file, you'll also need to add/edit some default settings in the just journal database under settings.
