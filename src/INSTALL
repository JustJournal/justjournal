This document is incomplete, but briefly outlines installing
justjournal.

JustJournal is developed on JDK 1.5 (java 5) on Mac OS X Tiger
using MySQL 5 and Apache Tomcat 5.5.  It has been successfully
deployed on FreeBSD 6 with the native 1.5 JDK using Apache
Tomcat 5.5 and MySQL 5.

Libraries needed for Just Journal:

sun:
Activation.jar  (JAF 1.02)
mail.jar
rowset.jar (sun.jdbc.CachedRowSet, old)
standard.jar

apache:
commons-beanutils
commons-collecitons 3.1
commons-email 1.0 (probably not needed anymore)
commons-fileupload 1.0
commons-logging
log4j 1.2.11 or 1.2.8

Maverick: (Sf.net)
maverick (2 years old, not sure on version right now)
opt-domify
opt-fop is currently not used
domify (seperate project now)

jdom

mysql-connector-java (3.1.10 currently used)

jazzy-core.jar (jazzy spell check engine sf.net)

additional probably not used:
jta-spec1_0_1.jar
jstl.jar
jdbc2_0-stdext.jar


I am not currently using war file deployments.  I've been
just pointing a context root in tomcat to a directory.  I'm working
on war deployments.  In addition, a database connection reference
must be created.  This is usually different among servlet container
implemenatations.

In tomcat, this might work in the web.xml
 <resource-ref>
        <description>DB Connection</description>
        <res-ref-name>jdbc/jjDB</res-ref-name>
        <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
        <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
        <res-sharing-scope>Shareable</res-sharing-scope>
    </resource-ref>

The current problem with just journal aside from war deployment,
is that it was a hack job originally and makes references both
to the domain name and / throughout the code.  I'm working on a
global settings class to fix these problems so the code is
reusable.

I'll include a web.xml and maverick.xml sample file eventually along
with xsl style sheets and jsp files needed to make the site work.  I'm
moving away from JSP currently toward XSL/XML.  Do to incompatibilities
with recent domify versions, i'll either need to move to cvs maverick or
drop it all together.

The database documentation is in /database.
