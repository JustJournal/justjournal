    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <p><strong>Can you nest comments?</strong></p>

    <p>no. I will add this feature in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>Do comments have any security?</strong></p>

    <p>no. All comments are public.</p>

    <p><strong>How much does the site cost?</strong></p>

    <p>Its free to use just journal.</p>

    <p><strong>Will you charge in the future?</strong></p>

    <p>I will always offer free accounts. Premium features are a possibility though. It costs me money to run the site.
        I will not take features away like live journal does. The site must be usable by most people for free.</p>

    <p><strong>What does all this stuff mean on the update journal page?</strong></p>

    <p>To post an entry, you need a date and body. Everything else including the subject is optional.</p>

    <p>If you choose not to enter a subject, (no subject) will be used in its place.</p>

    <p>Moods allow you to express how you feel. Some moods have a cute icon associated with them. </p>

    <p>Location indicates where you are writing the journal entry from. I occasionally use it to let others know i'm
        writing from work or college. </p>

    <p>Security controls who can read your journal. Public means that everyone on the internet can read it if they know
        the address to your journal or if they do a search. Friends means only people on your friends list on just
        journal can read your entries. It offers some security while still letting people you know enjoy your thoughts.
        Private means that no one can read your journal entry except you. (note that journal entries are stored clear
        text so sys admins could see entries by accident)</p>

    <p>Spell check runs your journal body through a simple spell checker. It does not post your entry when you select
        this option. It will bring you back to the update page with a list of words to correct.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I change the look of my journal? </strong></p>

    <p>Yes. There are several ways to do so. </p>

    <p>One option is to select a different theme in the preferences. Right now there is only one layout but 5 different
        color themes. I plan to offer more options in the future for layouts.</p>

    <p>If you know a little about CSS, you can use the style override preference to add styles to your journal. Many
        aspects of the journal have unique class names and ids to aide in altering the look and feel. </p>
