        <h2>Mood List</h2>

        <p>
            This is the complete list of moods that you can choose from when posting a journal entry.
            Parent moods are used to display an emoticon for a mood if the mood does not have its own emoticon.
            (smiley, etc) Picking a mood is optional when posting a journal entry.
