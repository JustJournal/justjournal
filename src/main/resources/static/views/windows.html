<h2>Windows Client</h2>

  <p class="firstone">The Windows client sits in the
      taskbar when its running and allows you to quickly post entries throughout the day. It also allows
      you to auto-detect the music playing on your computer.
      You can even use the Microsoft Word spell checker if Word is
      installed or add blog entries to Microsoft Outlook.</p>

  <h3>1.7 Release</h3>

  <p>This version includes a slightly new theme, Outlook integration is back, and runs on .NET framework 3.5. Tagging
      was also introduced into the client. It works just like the online form with spaces or commas separating tags.
      You
      can turn on the music detection feature in options. At this time, it only ships as a 32bit program, but can run
      on 64bit Vista. Released May 29, 2009.</p>
