Building JustJournal

JustJournal uses maven 3 to build.  You can use the standard mvn package to get a war file.

Requirements:
Java 6 or higher
Maven 3
MySQL 5.6 server
Tomcat 7

Note:
Work is underway to migrate to Spring DATA.  This ORM will replace
the hackish data access code using the old Sun CachedRowSet.  There are
known deployment problems on newer versions of MySQL as they changed the
way aliases are handled.  (SELECT fieldname as something from tablename; something
won't show up in the CachedRowSet with MySQL 5.5.25)

I am not currently using war file deployments.  I've been
just pointing a context root in tomcat to a directory.  I'm working
on war deployments.  In addition, a database connection reference
must be created.  This is usually different among servlet container
implementations.

In tomcat, this might work in the web.xml
   <resource-ref>
        <description>DB Connection</description>
        <res-ref-name>jdbc/jjDB</res-ref-name>
        <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
        <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
        <res-sharing-scope>Shareable</res-sharing-scope>
    </resource-ref>

The current problem with just journal aside from war deployment,
is that it was a hack job originally and makes references both
to the domain name and / throughout the code.  I'm working on a
global settings class to fix these problems so the code is
reusable.

The database schema & documentation is in /database.
