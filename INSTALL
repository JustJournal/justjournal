Building JustJournal

JustJournal uses maven 3 to build.  You can use the standard mvn package to get a deployable jar.

Requirements:
Java 17 or higher
Maven 3.x
MySQL 8.0.x server
Tomcat 9.x (included with spring)

Spring data migration is complete.

The current problem with just journal
is that it was a hack job originally and makes references both
to the domain name and / throughout the code.  I'm working on a
global settings class to fix these problems so the code is
reusable.

The database schema & documentation is in /database.

Place the deployable jar on the server.  Run at startup using your preferred mechanism.

There is an example rc.d script in rc.d called jj.  It should work on MidnightBSD or FreeBSD.

Use the following to enable on your BSD OS
sysrc jj_enable="YES"
